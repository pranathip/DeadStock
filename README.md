## Overview
### Description
DeadStock is a convenient way to see how the sneaker market is doing, track its history, and help investors/buyers alike plan their next sale/purchase. After a user creates their profile among various other features, they can customize their dashboard to display data for specific sneaker styles and brands of interest. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Business/Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** The mobile interface of the app allows users to conveniently track sneaker trends and data at their finger tips.
- **Story:** Allows users to keep track of trends and recent drops/sneaker news with a simple, straight-forward interface. Think - Apple's stocks app for sneakers.
- **Market:** Anyone who is a sneakerhead, interested in the trends/data behind the sneaker market, or wants to buy coveted colorways could enjoy this app.
- **Habit:** Users could open this app regularly to keep tabs on a specific shoe's price increases/decreases, especially if they're looking to make a purchase or are deciding whether or not they should hold/sell stock. Sneaker prices can fluctuate daily depending on major drops, pop culture, or other social phenomena.
- **Scope:** I believe the scope of this app is quite doable, with an ample amount of "required" stories that still make the app appealing for its purpose. The main challenge will be to find a good way to integrate all the trends/data I wish to display about each sneaker.
